    we will add the read number everytime to a variable sum, and
    for every number read, we will increment the counter
    then at end we will display average by dividing the sum by count
    For minimum and max, we will initialise the first number read as min and max both
    Then for next every number, we will compare with min and max, if a smaller value than min comes
    we will assign it to min, or if a larger value than max comes, we will assign it to The
