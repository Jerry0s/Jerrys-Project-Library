<summary><h2>Fibonacci Sequence</h2></summary>

The Fibonacci sequence is a set of integers (the Fibonacci numbers) that starts with a zero, followed by a one, then by another one, and then by a series of steadily increasing numbers. The sequence follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence begins with the following 14 integers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 ...

Each number, starting with the third, adheres to the prescribed formula. For example, the seventh number, 8, is preceded by 3 and 5, which add up to 8.

That being said, I created a code that allows users to play around with the Fibonacci sequence. You can try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Fibonacci%20Sequence)!

<summary><h2>Judge Scorer</h2></summary>

This project takes 5 scores from 5 judges and then calc... [here] (https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Judge%20Scorer)

<summary><h2>Name Sorter</h2></summary>

This project sorts out a list of names in alphabetical order. Users are able to input whatever name they wise and the program sorts i by looking through the functions of the arrays and the num of names within the array. You can try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Name%20Sorter)!

<summary><h2>Statistics Program</h2></summary>

*In order to utilize this program to its maximum capabilities, create a txt file (name can be anything) and input as many numbers as you like!*

This program will create a file object and open it. If the file fails to be opened, the result will be False and will exit and display an error message. 

If the file succeeds, the program will continue reading till the end of the file. Next, it would add the read number each time towards a variable sum. For exery number read, it will increment the counter. At the end, it will display the average of the file as a whole by dividing the sum by the count.

Finally, as a result, it would display for the file;
- number of numbers entered
- the largest value
- the smallest value
- the average value

You can try out the program [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Statistics%20Program)!

<summary><h2>Password Verifier</h2></summary>

This password verifier is a program that evaluates the strength of digital passwords. The verifier assesses the password's resilience to being guessed outright or cracked by cybercriminals using computer-automated hacking tools. You can try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Password%20Verifier)!

<summary><h2>Exam Grader (Array Version)</h2></summary>

* Array Version - a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.*

The program will read a txt file that contains numbers of students' answers and reads it through in order to calculate the overall percentage and displays it by 2 decimal places. 

You can try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Exam%20Grader%20(Array%20Version))!

</details>

<details id=9>
<summary><h2>Exam Grader (Vector Version)</h2></summary>

* Vector Version - Implemented as dynamic arrays; Just as regular arrays, vector containers have their elements stored in contiguous storage locations, which means that their elements can be accessed not only using iterators but also using offsets on regular pointers to elements.

The program will read a txt file that contains numbers of students' answers and reads it through in order to calculate the overall percentage and displays it by 2 decimal places. 

You can try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Exam%20Grader%20(Vector%20Version))!

<summary><h2>Grade List (Array Expander)</h2></summary>

* Array Expander - allows you to take a column of arrays and split each item in the array into its own row of data. This will effectively expand the rows of data you have to be at the granularity of each array item.
  
This program displays the grades or numerical values of a file through array expanders. It also displays the orignal sizes of the array and the new array sizes. Try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Grade%20List%20-%20Array%20Expander)!

<summary><h2>Median Finder</h2></summary>

This project reads 2 different files, an ODD file that contains odd numbers and an EVEN file that contains even numbers. Users have the ability to choose which file they want to open and te program calculates the average/median total of chosen file. Try the program [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Median%20Finder)!

<summary><h2>Number Sorter (Least -> Greatest)</h2></summary>

This program takes the values that it contains and orders each of them from least to greatest. Users can change the values to any number they wish! Try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Number%20Sorter%20(Least%20-%3E%20Greatest))

</details>

<details id=13>
<summary><h2>Student Overall Grader</h2></summary>

This program reads two different files, 'studentAnswers' and 'correctAnswers'  and displays which questions are correct and incorrect. If there is a perfect score, the program will notify in the end that the file has '100% accuracy.' Try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Grader)
