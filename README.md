_Welcome to my GitHub "Project database"! :wave:_

<summary><h2>Fibonacci Sequence</h2></summary>

The Fibonacci sequence is a set of integers (the Fibonacci numbers) that starts with a zero, followed by a one, then by another one, and then by a series of steadily increasing numbers. The sequence follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence begins with the following 14 integers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 ...

Each number, starting with the third, adheres to the prescribed formula. For example, the seventh number, 8, is preceded by 3 and 5, which add up to 8.

That being said, I created a code that allows users to play around with the Fibonacci sequence. You can try it out [here](https://github.com/Jerry0s/Jerrys-Project-Library/blob/main/Fibonacci%20Sequence)!
